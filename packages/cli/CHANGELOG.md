## 0.6.1

* Fix that `@lionweb/validation` was not specified as a (non-dev) dependency.


## 0.6.0

* Change the `diagram` command to output PlantUML and Mermaid diagram files _per language_.
* Add a `validation` commmand to validate JSON files as serialization chunks.
* Remove the shortening functionality from `extract`.
* Rename the `extract` command &rarr; `sort`, and remove the textualization for chunks that are the serialization of languages.
* Textualizing a serialization chunk of languages will use the LionCore/M3-specific syntax _unless_ the flag `--languagesAsRegular` is an argument.
* Add a `repair` command.
* Add a `textualize` command – that's optionally language-aware – to render a JSON serialization chunk as pure text.


## 0.5.0

This is the first version corresponding to a release of LionWeb (version: 2023.1) as a whole.

* Make language-related functionality "multi-lingual", i.e. a serialization chunk can contain multiple `Language`s.
    * (Languages will be sorted by name.)
* Improve extraction functionality: only catch JSON-parsing exceptions.
* Configure single entrypoint named `lionweb-cli`.


## Prior to 0.5.0

No changelog has been kept for previous versions, regardless of whether these were published or not.
