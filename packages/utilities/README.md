# The `utilities` package

An NPM package that can be added to a Node.js/NPM codebase as follows:

```shell
$ npm add @lionweb/utilities
```
It contains utilities on top of the `core` package, such as:

* diagram generation (PlantUML and Mermaid) from an M2
* an Ecore &rarr; M2 importer
* functions to sort or shorten a serialization to make introspection easier

Build it from source as follows:

```
