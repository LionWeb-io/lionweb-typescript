# Changelog

## 0.7.1

(The 0.7.0 release was deprecated because its `validation` package was faulty.)

* Initial creation and publication of this package, as an extraction and de-duplication from `@lionweb/core`, `@lionweb/utilities`, `@lionweb/class-core`, and `@lionweb/validation`.
* Add 'mapFrom' function that maps an array to a map, using given key and value functions.
* Introduce explicit types for `nested{1,2,3}Mapper` functions.
* Package `src/` again (— i.e., don't ignore for NPM packaging.)
