# Changelog

## 0.6.3

* Made validation aware that the `value` field of a property serialization is allowed to be `null`.


## 0.6.2

* Don't rely on the JavaScript features – import assertions – that are still marked as experimental.
  (This necessitates explicitly copying the relevant JSON files.)


## Prior versions

No changelog has been kept for previous versions, regardless of whether these were published or not.
