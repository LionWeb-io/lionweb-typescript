# README

This directory contains generated PlantUML UML class diagrams which represent certain models:

* [`library-gen.puml`](./library-gen.puml): the hand-crafted "library" metamodel.
* [`library-imported-from-ecore-gen.puml`](./library-imported-from-ecore-gen.puml): the "library" metamodel, as imported from Ecore.
* [`metametamodel-gen.puml`](./metametamodel-gen.puml): the (self-defined) LIonCore/M3 meta-metamodel.

All of these diagrams also have a corresponding MarkDown document with an embedded [Mermaid diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/).
